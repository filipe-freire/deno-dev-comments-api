      "// At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about the Adobe PSD\n// format. PSD is not a good format. PSD is not even a bad format. Calling it\n// such would be an insult to other bad formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD\n// is an abysmal format. Having worked on this code for several weeks now, my\n// hate for PSD has grown to a raging fire that burns with the fierce passion\n// of a million suns.\n//\n// If there are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do both, in\n// different places. It will then make up three more ways no sane human would\n// think of, and do those too. PSD makes inconsistency an art form. Why, for\n// instance, did it suddenly decide that *these* particular chunks should be\n// aligned to four bytes, and that this alignement should *not* be included in\n// the size? Other chunks in other places are either unaligned, or aligned with\n// the alignment included in the size. Here, though, it is not included. Either\n// one of these three behaviours would be fine. A sane format would pick one.\n// PSD, of course, uses all three, and more.\n//\n// Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find something in the\n// attic of your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark\n// attack on his 58th birthday. That last detail may not be important for the\n// purposes of the simile, but at this point I am spending a lot of time\n// imagining amusing fates for the people responsible for this Rube Goldberg of\n// a file format.\n//\n// Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest specs for the PSD file format.\n// To do this, I had to apply to them for permission to apply to them to have\n// them consider sending me this sacred tome. This would have involved faxing\n// them a copy of some document or other, probably signed in blood. I can only\n// imagine that they make this process so difficult because they are intensely\n// ashamed of having created this abomination. I was naturally not gullible\n// enough to go through with this procedure, but if I had done so, I would have\n// printed out every single page of the spec, and set them all on fire. Were it\n// within my power, I would gather every single copy of those specs, and launch\n// them on a spaceship directly into the sun.\n//\n// PSD is not my favourite file format.",
